# flui
flui is a library for creating lightweight cross platform UI's in Java using  [jimgui](https://github.com/ice1000/jimgui), the highly efficient  [dear imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) Java binding. flui includes many of the widgets commonly used in desktop applications and allows you to build your code in a declarative manner. flui widgets are just abstractions over already existing imgui widgets with some changes. Custom widgets will also be created in the future which will be a combination of existing widgets. A declarative style is the prefered "flui way" of building your UI but is not mandatory. If you prefer to create your UI using an imperative style approach instead, that is also possible.

At the moment this project is still a work in progress, there are no releases yet because there's some core features that need to be implemented first and the API is still changing very frequently.
