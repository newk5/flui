# flui
flui is a library for creating lightweight cross platform UI's in Java using  [jimgui](https://github.com/ice1000/jimgui), the highly efficient  [dear imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) Java binding. Flui includes many of the widgets commonly used in desktop applications and allows you to build your code in a declarative manner. Flui also puts a strong emphasis on code readability and uses fluent setters for all its widgets. A declarative style is the prefered "flui way" of building your UI but is not mandatory. If you prefer to create your UI using an imperative style approach instead, that is also possible.
